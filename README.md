# time_quota
Time tracking/management app written in Dart using the flutter framework

# motivation

Almost all time tracking apps I have come acrros have this monolithic approach to time tracking which mainly evolves around allocation of a set amount of time to a specific task. This approach is quite efficient in cases where one has a fixed set of responsilbilities e.g fixed school/work related goals to be met. For goals that don't have immediate time contraints, it gets harder to accurately track the amount of time allocated to a specific task. A simple example of this would be a set of goals that one would setup as part of some new years resolution. Simply saying I need to read X books or spend X minutes doing Y each month, gets harder to track and stay commited to. This app aims to approch this by creating time ratio's between multiple activities where an increase or decrease in activity X will likewise result in an increase or decrease in activity Y. This is best illustrated by an example where a goals could be set by building a set of rules like every 10 minutes spent working results in a 1 minute increase in availbale free/play time. It overall creates some sort of reward system that awards you with a free time in exchange for commiting a certain amount time to a different task. More on this later.
